# Deployment Proposal for REALTIME  PII Detection Solution
Overview

The solution identifies and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from structured or semi-structured data sets. Identified PII is partially masked in a human-readable way. For example:

Names: abbreviated to initials (John Doe → JXXX DXXX)

Phone numbers: partially obscured (9876543210 → 98XXXX3210)

Aadhaar numbers: partially obscured (1234 5678 9012 → 1234 XXXX XXXX)

Email IDs and UPI IDs: partially masked (abc@example.com → abXXXX@example.com)

This keeps sensitive information safe while providing sufficient structure to enable downstream processing, analytics, and reporting.

Deployment Strategy
Recommended Approach: Browser Extension

We recommend deploying the solution as a browser extension, which offers the following benefits:

Layer of Operation:

The extension exists at the application layer, intercepting web form submits, file uploads, or API calls before they hit the server.

This keeps sensitive data masked before it leaves the client, minimizing exposure risk.

Scalability

Browser extensions grow naturally with the size of the user base, needing little infrastructure.

Changes to mask rules or patterns can be automatically pushed to users.

Latency:

Processing occurs locally within the browser, creating minimal latency.

Users see virtually immediate feedback without introducing server-side bottlenecks.

Cost-effectiveness:

Because the heavy lifting occurs on the client, server resources and storage expense are reduced.

No additional server infrastructure is needed to roll out the PII masking logic.

Ease of Integration:

Can be deployed by end-users with little technical expertise.  

Operates across several web applications with no backend adjustments.  

Does support integration with file uploads, CRM software, and internal reporting systems.

Justification

Humanized masking ensures redacted data is readable and plausible, enhancing usability in logs, dashboards, or analytics.

Client-side deployment lessens the risk of exposure, prevents latency caused by server-side processing, and scales seamlessly with user expansion.

Flexible design permits extension of the solution to internal tools or browser apps.

Low cost of operation as most of the processing is on the user device, thereby minimizing server needs.

Summary

Implementing this PII discovery and humanized redaction solution as a browser extension provides:

Sensitive information is safeguarded before it exits the client

Data stays human-readable for analysis and reporting

The solution can be scaled, cost-efficient, and simple to integrate

This method offers a real-world, user-friendly, and privacy-friendly solution for organizations dealing with sensitive user information.
